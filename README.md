# From Design to Deployment: Data Warehousing with Azure Synapse Analytics 
The repo simulates query load, optimizes performance, and offers practical guidance for building data warehouses with Azure Synapse Analytics. üöÄ
The project follows the following architecture,

![Infrastructure Diagram](Assets/working-Animation.gif)

# Directories üìÇ

1. **data:** The datasets, fact, and dimension tables for the data warehouse
2. **Queries_Part4.sql:** SQL code for querying and analyzing the created data warehouse
3. **setup.json:** ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template. It is a block of code that defines the infrastructure and configuration for the project
4. **setup.ps1:** PowerShell script to provision the Azure Synapse Workspace along with the tables of the data warehouse (configured in setup.sql)
5. **setup.sql:** SQL script for creating the tables of the data warehouse
6. **table_creation_codes.sql:** SQL script to create the fact and dimension tables with dedicated SQL pool

## Prerequisites:
1. An active Azure subscription
2. Knowledge of Azure Data Fundamentals, [Good to begin from here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/dp-900t00)

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tahhnik/Designing-Large-Scale-Data-Warehouse-with-Azure-Synapse-Analytics.git

### To Set Up on the Azure Portal (Detailed walkthrough is in the blog posts)
   **Clone the repository inside Azure workspace through PowerShell on Azure Portal**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/tahhnik/Designing-Large-Scale-Data-Warehouse-with-Azure-Synapse-Analytics.git
   ```
![synapase-ui-shell-gitclone](https://github.com/tahhnik/Designing-Large-Scale-Data-Warehouse-with-Azure-Synapse-Analytics/assets/25973761/6624d5a1-dc98-45a3-b819-63f3344e659e)
   

2. **Explore the Directories:**
   Navigate into each directory to find detailed automation scripts, SQL codes for queries, and configurations.

3. **Follow the Blog:**
   Implementation details and insights are documented in the associated [series of blog posts in Medium](URL_HERE).
   
      ‚ö°**If you want to skip the initial processes like data modeling, and schema design and directly jump onto building the warehouse on Azure Synapse Analytics, _follow the Blog Three_**,
   
      ‚ö°**If you want to skip the building warehouse processes on Azure Synapse Analytics and directly jump onto querying the tables with SQL (T-SQL in this context), _follow the Blog Four_**
   
   
## Tools Explored üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Enterprise analytics service for data warehouses and big data systems.
2. **Azure Portal**: Unified console to manage Azure resources.
3. **Azure Stream Analytics**: Real-time stream processing engine.
4. **Azure Machine Learning**: Cloud service for ML project lifecycle.
5. **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Scalable storage for data lakes.
6. **Power BI**: Business analytics service for data visualization.
7. **Azure Function Apps**: Serverless applications for event-driven scenarios.
8. **Azure Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed, multi-model database.


## Blog Implementation üìù
