# From Design to Deployment: Data Warehousing with Azure Synapse Analytics
The repo simulates query load, optimizes performance, and offers practical guidance for building data warehouses with Azure Synapse Analytics. üöÄ
The project follows the following architecture,
![Infrastructure Diagram](Assets/working-Animation.gif)

# Directories üìÇ

1. **data:** The datasets, fact, and dimension tables for the data warehouse
2. **Queries_Part4.sql:** SQL code for querying and analyzing the created data warehouse
3. **setup.json:** ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template. It is a block of code that defines the infrastructure and configuration for the project
4. **setup.ps1:** PowerShell script to provision the Azure Synapse Workspace along with the tables of the data warehouse (configured in setup.sql)
5. **setup.sql:** SQL script for creating the tables of the data warehouse
6. **table_creation_codes.sql:** SQL script to create the fact and dimension tables with dedicated SQL pool
